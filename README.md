# UcglibSwiftIO

Port of Ucglib to SwiftIO.

## What is Ucglib?

The **U**niversal **C**olor **G**raphics **Lib**rary is an easily portable library originally targeted at the Arduino family of boards, which supports a wide variety of display controllers listed below.

You can get the original library [here](https://github.com/olikraus/Ucglib_Arduino).
The original documentation applies to both the original library as well as this wrapper.

This Swift package is simply a SwiftIO wrapper for the Ucglib drivers themselves.
